## Introduction
We created a game similair to [GeoGuessr](https://www.geoguessr.com/). The players will be randomly placed somewhere on Google maps (for example: a country, a city or a monumental place like the eiffel tower). At the beginning of the game the map won't be visible and there are some clouds over the map. The goal of the player is to brush away as little as possible of the clouds to recognize the place he is located in. The player will give his answer by placing a pin on a map that is displayed on the lower left side of the screen. The scoring will be based on points. Depending on the game mode points are computed by time, accuracy of guess and amount of clouds brushed away.

## High-level components

_High-level components: Identify your project’s 3-5 main components. What is their role?
How are they correlated? Reference the main class, file, or function in the README text
with a link._
TODO: insert a graphic

## Launch & Deployment

_Launch & Deployment: Write down the steps a new developer joining your team would
have to take to get started with your application. What commands are required to build and run your project locally? How can they run the tests? Do you have external dependencies or a database that needs to be running? How can they do releases?_

## Illustrations

_Illustrations: In your client repository, briefly describe and illustrate the main user flow(s) of your interface. How does it work (without going into too much detail)? Feel free to include a few screenshots of your application._
